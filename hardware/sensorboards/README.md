# What do we have here?

### For the CNY70 (thru-hole mounting) sensor

* simple-1x
  * A single sensor board that tries to be generically useful
* 2040-centered-1x
  * A single sensor board that centers the sensor across the 40mm wide portion of a 20x40mm tslot aluminum extrusion.
* 2040-centered-2x
  * Same thing, but two sensors on one board.
* 2040-centered-4x
  * Same thing, but four sensors on one board.
* 2040-centered-4x-12deg
  * Same thing, but four sensors on one board and they're rotated 12 degrees, for bass hammers.
* 2020-offset-1x
  * A single sensor board that places the sensor to one side of a 20x20mm extrusion, and the connector on the other side.
* 2020-offset-2x
  * Same thing, but two sensors on one board.
* 2020-offset-4x
  * Same thing, but four sensors on one board.

### For the QRE1113GR (SMT) sensor

* 2040-centered-4x-QRE1113GR
  * Like 2040-centered-4x but with a QRE1113GR instead of CNY70

### For QRE1113 (thru-hole mounting) and EAITRCA6 (thru-hole mounting)

* TBD, note that the pins are the same as in the previous and identical between the two
