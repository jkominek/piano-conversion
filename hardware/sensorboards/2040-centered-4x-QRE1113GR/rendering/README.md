To redo the rendering including the extrusions, you will have to get their CAD, which I am not authorized to distribute.
If you are ok to render without them, no action is needed, otherwise you have to download the following files

HFS5-4040-150.igs
HFSQN4-1050-100.igs

which you can do from the "CAD Download" menu, then selecting 3D and finally IGES.

The URLs are

If you intend to purchase these extrusions, make sure to select the correct length and not these silly short ones made only
for rendering!!
